# IRC
Internet Relay Chat.
	
Is a text-based chat system for instant messaging.

	In this project we've been told to create a simple and functional IRC server.

This server must work with one specific IRC client (limeChat).

We only implemented semple commands like (PRIVMSG, NOTICE, JOIN, PART, KICK and MODE).

But to make this server as standard as possible, we have implemented it following the standard IRC protocal.
